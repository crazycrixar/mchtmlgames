Hey there! Welcome to my Crappy Games repository! ðŸ˜„ Here, you'll find a bunch of experimental game projects, some of which didn't quite hit the mark. Let's take a quick look at a few of them:

## MCbuild (Success)
![MCbuild](MCbuild.png)

MCbuild is a 2D bulding game inspired by Minecraft's building mechanics. It was a bit of a struggle during development, but hey, I made it work! you can build and construct buildings using different blocks and tools. Yay for progress!

## MCcraft (Failed)

MCcraft was an ambitious attempt to create a complex Minecraft-style game, but things didn't go as planned. Technical difficulties and time constraints got the best of me, resulting in its failure. But hey, we learn from our mistakes, right?

## MCcreate MULTIPLAYER (Failed)

MCcreate MULTIPLAYER was all about building and creating with your friend in a 2d block game with  arrow key multiplayer support. Sounds cool, right? Sadly, the multiplayer part didn't work out as I hoped, and the project ended up as a failed experiment.

## Mcmine (Complete)

Ah, Mcmine! This one's a winner! It's my first successful project, where I managed to create a fully functional game. It's inspired by classic mining games, where players can mine blocks. Success at last!

Just so you know, these games were created for learning purposes, not for commercial release. Feel free to dive into the repository and check out each game's folder for more details. Got any questions or suggestions? Hit me up anytime!

Happy Coding!
